		<h1>Step # 5</h1>
		<p>
The fifth agreement is to let go of the word "sorry." There is a tendency in our culture, it seems, to be overly apologetic. A lot of people apologize unconsciously and spontaneously, for things they don’t actually feel sorry for. In some situations it is almost expected to excuse ourselves. Two people reached the water fountain at the same time, for example, and one or both of them apologizes. A guy comes out of the bathroom after a bowel movement and sees someone else waiting to enter: he apologizes and slinks away. A girl stretches out and accidentally bumps something—“Sorry.” What are they really sorry for? An outside observer, after hearing people say it so many times for so many things, might logically conclude that they’re sorry for everything, even their own existences. To take it even further, I sometimes wonder if we’ve been conditioned to say we’re sorry because the people in power know that language is powerful and that the Word takes on flesh. The more they can get other people to say they’re “sorry,” then, the sorrier those others become, and the easier they are to control. This is not a permanent agreement. Apologizing, using the word sorry, has it’s time and place. For the purposes of retreats and of this book, however, it is useful to temporarily let it go. That way, we can sit with our thoughts and emotions a little longer before apologizing them away. Plus, if you’re attached to using the word sorry to the extent that not using it for the duration of a retreat causes some resistance, this is a great opportunity to practice life without it. "I agree to let go of the word 'sorry.'"
