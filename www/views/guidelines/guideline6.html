		<h1>Step # 6</h1>
		<p>
The sixth guideline is to stay with conversations until there is a mutual or collective sense of completion. The truth is bottomless, and the well always refills. It is possible, however, to reach plateaus of understanding. When you’ve expressed your truth fully, you get a satisfying feeling of emptiness and completion. We’re all in this together, and we can stay with others until they experience the same satisfaction. "I agree to stay with the communication until a sense of completion is reached."
