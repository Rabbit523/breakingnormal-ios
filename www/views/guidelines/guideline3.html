		<h1>Step # 3</h1>
		<p>
The third guideline is to let go of violence and threatening language. Where violence begins, connection ends. REALationships are about trust, understanding innerstanding, and give and take. Violence is about domination and control. The person who uses violence is actually being usedâ€”by their emotions. Murder, let it be known, is a form of suicide. Even something like walking away from a conversation, or raising your voice over another person, is a form of violence. "I agree to be free of violence and threatening language."
