		<h1>Step # 7</h1>
		<p>
The seventh agreement is to expect nothing and experience everything. It's about expectations and experience. Let go of attachment to results and outcomes, and instead, get out of your head, get into your heart, and glow with the flow. "I agree to expect nothing and experience everything."
