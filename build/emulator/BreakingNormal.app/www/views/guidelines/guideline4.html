		<h1>Step # 4</h1>
		<p>
The fourth guideline is to ask for what you want, and not be attached to getting it. In the past, there might have been times when we wanted something but didn’t ask for it aloud, out of fear or shyness. Instead, it was like we unconsciously expected the people around us to pick it up through ESP. When they didn’t, we resented them in secret. Asking for what we want is an extension of telling the truth. Not being attached to getting it, on the other hand, is acknowledging that other people are not in this world to live up to our expectations. Personally, I want others to give me something because they want to, not because they feel like they should. My friend and author Brandon Hawk says that when we give beyond our capacity, we make the receiver a thief. By the same token, when others give to us beyond their capacity, they might view us as thieves. "I agree to ask for what I want, and not be attached to getting it."
